## What is Sesh Map:
Sesh Map is a Mongodb Express React.js Node.js web application. Fundamentally, it is a crowdsourced and interactive map which users can use to find awesome new surfing/skating/hiking/rock-climbing locations, as well as upload their favorite spots for other users to check out. Additionally, we created a forum where users can talk about and share news on specific sports they are interested in.
