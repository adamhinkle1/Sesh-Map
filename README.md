# Sesh-Map

Sesh Map is a Mongodb Express React.js Node.js web application built by Adam Hinkle, David Arroyo, and Omar Kermiche for CSULB CECS 491.

Sesh Map is fundamentally a crowdsourced and interactive map which users can use to find new surfing/skating/hiking/rock-climbing locations, 
as well as upload their favorite spots for other users to check out. Additionally, we created a forum where users can interact about 
specific sports they are interested in.
